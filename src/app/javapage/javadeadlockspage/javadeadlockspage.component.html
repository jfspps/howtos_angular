<h5>Deadlocks</h5>

<p>
    The deadlock arises because each thread is trying to acquire locks in different order. For example, thread1 seeks lock 1 then lock 2; thread2 seeks lock 2 then lock 1. If they tried to seek both locks in the same order then a deadlock would not occur. These issues can be further complicated with more locks.
