<h5>Java Collections</h5>

<p>
    What follows is a brief overview of major data structures and methods from the Java Collections framework (part of the Java utils package).
</p>

<p>
    The Collection interface is an extension of Iterable, an interface that allows for the foreach loop. Sub-interfaces of Collection include Deque, List, Queue, and Set. These sub-interfaces are implemented by, as relevant, the Collections class (contrast to the Collection interface) along with the Deque, List, Queue, and Set classes. Furthermore, these classes have other other subclasses, including ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, HashSet and HashMap to name a few.
</p>

<p>
    The Vector class can be viewed as a synchronised (prevents other threads from changing the state of the List when it resides in the heap) implementation of ArrayList and has many of the same methods, including <span class="commands">addElement()</span>, <span class="commands">indexOf()</span>, <span class="commands">firstElement()</span> and <span class="commands">removeElement()</span>. It was introduced in Java 1.2 and is seldom used in modern applications. Some authors demonstrate how the Vector instance is not completely thread-safe despite being synchronised. Whenever thread safety is not a concern, use ArrayList instead.
</p>

<h5>Foreach, Iterator and ListIterator</h5>

<p>
    Both the foreach loop and Iterator interfaces allow one to traverse a collection and retrieve the contents of a collection. (Foreach is demonstrated in <a routerLink="/java/javaLambdas">Lambdas and streams</a>.) Additionally, the Iterator interface or its extension, the ListIterator interface, provide extra features. The Iterator interface allows for elements to be removed. The ListIterator interface extends Iterator and allows for bidirectional traversal as well as modification of the elements. All collections have an <span class="commands">iterator()</span> and <span class="commands">listIterator()</span> methods which returns an iterator/listIterator and is initially placed at the start of a collection.
</p>

<h5>Comparable and Comparator interfaces</h5>

<p>
    Comparable and Comparator are interfaces which allow one to sort collections or lists. Overall, if sorting of objects needs to be based on one default (natural) order then use Comparable. If sorting needs to be based on multiple attributes of different objects or when the domain object source code cannot be altered, then use Comparator.
</p>

<h6>Comparable</h6>

<p>
    Comparable declares the <span class="commands">compareTo()</span> method, which can compare Strings. The command <span class="commands">string1.compareTo(string2)</span> can identify which string should precede which. If strings should be listed alphabetically, left-to-right, then a negative return means string1 is 'behind' string2 and should go before string2. A positive return means string1 is 'ahead' of string2 and should go after string2. The extent to which a string is ahead or behind is relayed in the return value.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="compareToExample" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    The next code snippet demonstrates a String, seatNumber. The <span class="commands">compareTo()</span> method returns a positive value if <span class="commands">this.seatNumber &gt; seat.getSeatNumber()</span>, a negative value if <span class="commands">this.seatNumber &lt; seat.getSeatNumber()</span> and zero if they are equal.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="compareTo" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    In short, the Comparable interface defines the <span class="commands">compareTo()</span> method which is evaluated to sort elements. The <span class="commands">Collections.sort()</span> method would then evaluate <span class="commands">compareTo()</span> to sort elements in ascending order. As defined, above, the order would be s1, s3 and s5. By default,
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Strings are sorted alphabetically</li>
    <li>Integers are sorted in ascending order</li>
    <li>Dates are sorted chronologically</li>
</ul>

<p>
    A custom Comparable <span class="commands">compareTo()</span> can be realised by implementing the Comparable interface, for the class (objects) that need sorting, and overriding <span class="commands">compareTo()</span>. 
</p>

<h6>Comparator</h6>

<p>
    The order can also be changed by building a Comparator instance. The Comparator interface defines one method: <span class="commands">compare()</span> (Comparator is a functional interface) and can provide a more custom sort method. Take care not to associate Comparators with <span class="commands">compareTo()</span>! The method <span class="commands">compareTo()</span> belongs to the Comparable interface, not the Comparator interface.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="comparator" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    According to the overridden method, the command <span class="commands">Collections.sort(priceSeats, Theatre.PRICE_ORDER);</span> then sorts the the list of Seats, priceSeats, by first by the order they were added (FIFO, lowest to highest index number) and then by price, from lowest price to highest. Elements are only swapped if they have different prices.
</p>

<p>
    More comparators can be applied with different sort criteria.
</p>

<p>
    Instead of building a Comparator instance, one could write a class which implements Comparator and then override <span class="commands">compare()</span>. Instantiating the class would then have the same effect. Call <span class="commands">Collections.sort(list, new CustomComparator());</span> to apply the custom comparator.
</p>

<h5>The List interface</h5>

<p>
    Lists can be copied by reference (a shallow copy) by initialising a new List as <span class="commands">List&lt;ClassID&gt; newList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(sourceList)</span>, in preference to <span class="commands">Collections.copy(dest, source)</span>.  Elements can be reversed and shuffled using <span class="commands">reverse()</span> and <span class="commands">shuffle()</span>. Reversing a list requires the implementation of the Comparable interface. The <span class="commands">min()</span> and <span class="commands">max()</span> methods return the smallest and largest numerical based element. One can also swap elements with <span class="commands">swap()</span>.
</p>

<h5>The Map interface</h5>

<p>
    This interface has a key and value pairings and replaces dictionaries. Maps can be implement with the HashMap generic class with <span class="commands">Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; someMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();</span>, for example. Keys are unique so all references, with <span class="commands">put()</span>, to the same key will overwrite the stored value. Keys are also immutable. The method <span class="commands">put()</span> returns the previous value if the key-value pair already exists and null if not.
</p>

<p>
    One can also use <span class="commands">containsKey()</span> to determine if a value already exists without overwriting it through <span class="commands">put()</span>. With regard to thread management, one can use <span class="commands">putIfAbsent()</span>, preventing two or more threads from writing to the map repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
    Removing elements from maps can be carried out with <span class="commands">remove()</span>. This method returns true is the key-value pair were found (and subsequently deleted) and false otherwise.
</p>

<p>
    One can replace an already mapped value (a value with a key present) with <span class="commands">replace()</span>. The method returns the original value if the key was found (and the original value updated) and null of the key was not found. One can also check the value also exists (in addition to the key) by using passing three parameters as: <span class="commands">someMap.replace(key, originalValue, newValue);</span> before replacing the originalValue. This provides more strict control over how key-values are replaced.
</p>

<p>
    The sub-classes and some of their characteristics are summarised below:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>HashMap: implemented as an array of linked lists, this tends to be used for quick lookup and insertion. Ordering of keys (not values) is arbitrary.</li>
    <li>TreeMap: implemented by a <a href="https://jfspps.github.io/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/24_Search_trees.html" target="_blank">Red-black Tree</a>, this naturally orders keys (alphabetically or numerically) and consequently must implement the Comparable interface's compareTo() method.</li>
    <li>LinkedHashMap: essentially provides lookup and insertion of the speed O(1) of HashMap and the ordering of TreeMap. The ordering is the same as the insertion order.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    More examples of LinkedHashMap and TreeMap are given at the end of this section.
</p>

<h5>The Set interface</h5>

<p>
    Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Sets are generic class based and have size() and isEmpty() methods. Generally, sets should store immutable objects or at the very least remain unique, otherwise the behaviour would be undefined and unpredictable. HashSets use hashes (using <span class="commands">hashCode()</span>) like Maps to provide fast access (O(1)) to each element. The element itself is also stored in an underlying HashMap, as the key with a dummy value added to the backing HashMap. Since HashMap keys are all unique, then the overarching Set elements are unique. Sets also have mathematical union and intersection type methods.
</p>

<p>
    Like Lists, shallow copies can be applied with <span class="commands">Set&lt;ClassID&gt; newSet = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(sourceSet)</span>. Elements are added with add() and a union of two sets is achieved with addAll(). The methods removeAll() and containsAll() are useful with mathematical Set logic. The method addAll() can be applied to the union of Sets, removeAll() applies to the difference of two sets and containsAll() (a non-destructive method) can be used to test if one Set is a Subset of another.
</p>

<h6>Overriding hashCode() and equals()</h6>

<p>
    When storing custom objects as keys in a HashMap or elements of a Set, it is highly recommended to override the <span class="commands">equals()</span> and <span class="commands">hashCode()</span> methods. To the compiler, objects will have subtle differences which enable objects to be stored in the set. If at least one property of the object is different then the object will be classed as unique. Their references (hashCode) will be different, and the default <span class="commands">equals()</span> method will apply a simple 'referential equality' which is 'object1 == object2'. This is not always apparent regarding the business logic however.
</p>

<p>
    Objects which are equal according to <span class="commands">equals()</span> have the same hashCode and reside in the same bucket (think of an array of linked lists). Each hashCode indicates which bucket the submitted object will reside in. The return of <span class="commands">hashCode()</span> does not depend on <span class="commands">equals()</span>, however, <span class="commands">equals()</span> does depend on <span class="commands">hashCode()</span>. The method <span class="commands">equals()</span> checks the hashed codes and assumes they are assigned correctly. If <span class="commands">hashCode()</span> was not overridden or set correctly then <span class="commands">equals()</span> may use the wrong hashed code and end up looking in the wrong bucket. The method <span class="commands">equals()</span> is unaware of this and so it never finds the required object. The submitted object can then be placed into the Set or HashMap, duplicating at least one of the other elements already present.
</p>

<p>
    This has subsequent problems, when the Set is iterated over, attempting to find or remove an object. The wrong object would be recalled or deleted.
</p>

<p>
    When overriding the methods, one can choose object properties which direct the compiler to establish if objects are the same or not. Take care not to overload the methods, as this just provides a different method signature which could still be called. Overriding means that the current class will use newly-defined method over the parent class method.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="hashCodeEquals" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    The @Override annotation directs the compiler to check the signature is correct.
</p>

<h6>instanceof and equals()</h6>

<p>
    Some thought is required though when overriding <span class="commands">equals()</span> for a class and its subclass. When <span class="commands">obj instanceof objClass</span> is used in the <span class="commands">equals()</span> method, it returns true. Similarly, it works for subclasses, so the following, <span class="commands">subClassObj instanceof objClass</span>, is also true. However, <span class="commands">obj instanceof objSubClass</span> is false. When <span class="commands">instanceof</span> is used as part of equals, define the overridden <span class="commands">equals()</span> method in the parent class only and allow the subclass to use the parent class' <span class="commands">equals()</span> method. In other words, do not override <span class="commands">equals()</span> in the subclass. To ensure this behaviour, mark the overridden <span class="commands">equals()</span> and <span class="commands">hashCode()</span> methods in the parent class as 'final'.
</p>

<h5>LinkedHashMap and TreeMap</h5>

<p>
    HashMaps and HashSets are chaotic and the sorted forms are LinkedHashMap and LinkedHashSet. They are ordered in the same order they were entered, that is, FIFO. The methods for Maps and Sets are very similar.
</p>

<p>
    Below is a more comprehensive example which summarises many of the concepts covered thus far.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="stockItem" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    Each stock item is stored in a list, StockList. Note how the HashMap is replaced with a LinkedHashMap, which preserves the order of the items that were added.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="stockList" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    StockItems can be added to a Basket. Note here that the Basket's list is built around a TreeMap. This causes the list to be sorted alphabetically, as defined in StockItem's <span class="commands">compareTo()</span> method, which ultimately uses String's <span class="commands">compareTo()</span>. Each time a StockItem is added to the TreeMap, the item name is compared using <span class="commands">compareTo()</span> each time. It checks where the next added StockItem should go. This will naturally result in a performance hit.
