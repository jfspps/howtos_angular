<h5>Java NIO files</h5>

<p>
    The Java NIO was introduced to provide a non-blocking implementation of Java IO. The speed and other design features
    of Java NIO as to whether the newer package is more effective or preferable is still debated. Java NIO handles
    streams in blocks of data.
</p>

<h5>Text files (NIO with IO)</h5>

<p>
    The first example below shows how text files are handled. In most cases, one uses a Path class with NIO and pass it
    to an instance of a Files class.

<h5>Binary files with serialisable objects (NIO with IO)</h5>

<p>
    Handling of binary files with NIO as shown below. Take note of the exceptions covered:
</p>

</pre>

<h5>Exclusive use of NIO</h5>

<p>
    Some terminology:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A <b>channel</b> is the data-source written to or read from</li>
    <li>A <b>buffer</b> is the container for the block of data passed (data must be of one type) and can be varied in length
    </li>
    <li><b>Selectors</b> (mostly used in large enterprise development) allow a single thread to manage multiple channels</li>
</ul>

<p>
    One channel can serve both reading and writing, and need not be buffered.
</p>

<h5>Writing data to a binary file</h5>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="soleNIOText" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    There are two methods which exemplify one of the main uses of Java NIO: <b>wrap()</b> and <b>flip()</b>. The wrap() method:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>ties the buffer with the byte array; changes to either one affects the other</li>
    <li>sets the position (index of the next element, <= capacity) of the buffer to zero</li>
    <li>the buffer's capacity (no. of elements) is set according to the size of the byte array (thus wrap() has a set capacity)</li>
    <li>the buffer's mark (initially undefined and used as a custom pointer; buffer's reset() sets the pointer to
        mark's) is undefined</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Each operation on the buffer (getInt() and putInt(), for example) advances the buffer's pointer one place forward. Quite often one needs to reset the pointer before reading or writing from/to the buffer. This is achieved with the flip() method. The flip() method also discards any custom mark. The example below writes Hello World followed by two Integers.
</p>

<h5>Reading data from a binary file</h5>

<p>
    The following section is a continuation of the above try block.
</p>

<p>
    The read() method: <span class="commands">public int read(byte[] b) throws IOException</span>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b. The number of bytes
        actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is
        detected, or an exception is thrown.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the length of b is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
        least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at the end of the file, the value -1 is returned;
        otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into b.
    </li>
    <li>
        The first byte read is stored into element b[0], the next one into b[1], and so on. The number of bytes read is,
        at most, equal to the length of b. Let k be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in
        elements b[0] through b[k-1], leaving elements b[k] through b[b.length-1] unaffected.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The following sends the input stream data (data.dat via channel) to 'buffer', with read(). Hint: whenever "flipping"
    from read to write, or vice versa, always call flip().
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="soleNIOread" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    One can access a particular element of the buffer with absolute read. Consequently, there is no need to always call flip().
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="soleNIOAbsoluteRead" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    With relative reads, the flip() method is used more often.
</p>

<h5>Copying files between channels and threads</h5>

<p>
    Files are coupled to Java NIO channels, and as such, one can copy file contents via their channels. The following transferTo() sends data from someOtherChannel to someFileChannel.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="FileChannel" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    Note that the position parameter is relative to the current position in the channel. One can also send data with respect to the destination channel with transferFrom(). The following is equivalent to the above transferTo().
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="FileChannel2" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    One can also transfer data between threads, via <b>pipes</b>. Pipes are one-way.
</p>

    <code [highlight]="pipes" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
