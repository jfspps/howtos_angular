<h5>Java NIO</h5>

<p>
    The Java NIO was introduced to provide a non-blocking implementation of Java IO. The speed and other design features of Java NIO as to whether the newer package is more effective or preferable is still debated. Java NIO handles streams in blocks of data.
</p>

<h5>Text files (NIO with IO)</h5>

<p>
    The first example below shows how text files are handled. In most cases, one uses a Path class with NIO and pass it to an instance of a Files class.

<h5>Binary files with serialisable objects (NIO with IO)</h5>

<p>
    Handling of binary files with NIO as shown below. Take note of the exceptions covered:

<h5>Exclusive NIO</h5>

<p>
    Some terminology. A 'channel' is the data-source written to or read from. A 'buffer' is the container for the block of data passed (data must be of one type) and can be varied in length. 'Selectors' (mostly used in large enterprise development) allow a single thread to manage multiple channels.
</p>

<p>
    One channel can serve both reading and writing, and need not be buffered.
</p>

<h5>Writing data to a binary file</h5>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="soleNIOText" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    The wrap() method:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>ties the buffer with the byte array, changes to either one affects the other</li>
    <li>sets the position (index of the next element, <= capacity) of the buffer to zero</li>
    <li>the buffer's capacity (no. of elements) is set according to the size of the byte array</li>
    <li>the buffer's mark (initially undefined and used as a custom pointer; buffer's reset() sets the pointer to mark's) is undefined</li>
</ul>

<p>
    When wrap() is called it sets the buffer capacity to equal the length of the array, the position is set to zero and mark remains undefined (can be set later). The example below writes Hello World followed by two Integers.
</p>

<h5>Reading data from a binary file</h5>

<p>
    The following section is a continuation of the above try block. The read() method: <span class="commands">public int read(byte[] b) throws IOException</span>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the length of b is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at the end of the file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into b.
    </li>
    <li>
        The first byte read is stored into element b[0], the next one into b[1], and so on. The number of bytes read is, at most, equal to the length of b. Let k be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements b[0] through b[k-1], leaving elements b[k] through b[b.length-1] unaffected.
    </li>
</ul>    

<p>
    The following sends the input stream data (data.dat via channel) to 'buffer', with read(). Hint: whenever "flipping" from read to write, or vice versa, always call flip().
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="soleNIOread" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    One can access a particular element of the buffer with absolute read. This differs from no parameters passed to getInt() which is relative read.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="soleNIOAbsoluteRead" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    With absolute reads, there is no need to always call flip().
