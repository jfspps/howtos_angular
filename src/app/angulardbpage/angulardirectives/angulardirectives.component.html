<h5>Angular directives</h5>

<p>
    This project highlights a number of inbuilt Angular directives, such as NgClass, NgStyle, NgIf, NgFor and NgSwitch, and how to build custom directives (e.g. changing HTML element attributes). Official events handled with @HostListener or DOM properties passed to a component with @HostBinding are also demonstrated.
