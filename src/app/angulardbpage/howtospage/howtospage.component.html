<h5>HowTos</h5>

<p>This project highlights a number of GibHub repositiories which demonstrates how to set up new projects, for example, Spring Security app or a JavaFX project. Each project example is developed with small commits and ongoing commentary. The project provides me with a quick reference to technologies that I have had experience with either from an online tutorial or course. HowTo's also links to programming notes that I have compiled, again, for future reference.</p>
