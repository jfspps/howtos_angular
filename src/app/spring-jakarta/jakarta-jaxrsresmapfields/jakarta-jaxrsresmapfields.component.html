<h5>Response objects</h5>

<p>
    Successful web service transactions normally return feedback (essentially metadata) to the client (a message, a HTTP status code, URI to the newly created resource etc.). This is where a "response object" comes into use.
</p>

<p>
    Previously, the return values of the resource methods were Java objects. Instead of this, one can return a Response, while facilitating the return of the metadata. The HTTP response body will contain the JSON array. The POST method returns the URI of the new resource in the HTTP header. The <span class="annot">@Context</span> annotation is used to inject classes/objects residing in the context.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="responseObject" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<h5>Exception Mappers</h5>

<p>
    When the client pushes a payload to the web service, its data should be validated. The JPA validates data with the Bean Validation API. JAX-RS also uses the same API to validate payloads and ensures that the data adheres to the constraints set in the model. The web service also sends a response to the client to inform the client of the status of the request.
</p>

<p>
    Any violation of the constraints are handled by the JAX-RS "exception mappers". The API maps exceptions to HTTP responses e.g. any bean violations on the server are mapped to a specific HTTP response. The implementation of exception mappers is normally defined in its own class, annotated with the <span class="annot">@Provider</span> to inform JAX-RS that this class should be made available to the container.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="exceptionMapper" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    Exception mappers are not only applicable to bean validation but also applicable to any Java exception.
</p>

<p>
    As set out, the web service will return a JSON array as a response body, listing the bean field constraints that were violated and a message explaining what the problem was (as defined in the <a routerLink="/springJakarta/jakartaOutro">bean validation</a>).
</p>

<p>
    Currently, the payload is validated during the JPA transaction, that is, when <span class="commands">someService.save()</span> is run. The validation is taking place at the persistence (service) level. To validate before the persistence layer (quite often a preferred approach, freeing up the entity manager) at the resource layer, apply the <span class="annot">@Valid</span> annotation to the injected instance.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="validateAtResourceLevel" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    Validating at the resource level does, however, return a different JSON response body. The messages are the same however the field names are more formal.
</p>

<h5>Form fields</h5>

<p>
    Clients can post data to web service via forms. The form handling class is, as with the bean validation exception mapping, defined in its own class. The relevant entity classes set their constraints as desired. As with Spring MVC and Thymeleaf templates, the client posts a form with the POST method. Note that the payload will not be sent as a JSON array and so it is necessary to add an extra annotation <span class="annot">@Consumes()</span> which overrides the class level <span class="annot">@Consumes()</span> annotation. Each field of the form that is injected by JAX-RS when annotated with <span class="annot">@FormParam()</span>, more elegantly with a MultiValuedMap or (most recommended approach) with a <span class="annot">@BeanParam()</span>. Spring developers will see that <span class="annot">@BeanParam()</span> resembles the Spring MVC Model interface.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="formFieldClass" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    Note that any entity field not annotated with <span class="annot">@FormParam()</span> will not be initialised through the <span class="annot">@BeanParam()</span> approach. Using the entity class directly eliminates the need to build a separate DTO (which is another approach that can be used to handle client form data).
</p>
