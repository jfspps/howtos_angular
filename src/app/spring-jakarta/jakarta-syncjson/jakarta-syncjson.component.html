<h5>Executing resource methods asynchronously</h5>

<p>
    Running methods asynchronously in the web service. Suppose the same method can be applied to multiple clients, for example, multiple clients want to monitor their users' account and find out how it is credited and debited over a few years. Such a process, running alongside all other processes is costly. To give the resource method time to process one can suspend the response and then either wait for the method to complete (and respond accordingly) or respond with a timeout. The costly method will be made to run on its own thread.
</p>

<p>
    To proceed, one can extend Java SE's ExecutorService with ManagedExecutorService (MES). The central piece is AsyncResponse's resume() method. One uses the MES to start a new thread (spawnedThread) and execute expensiveMethod(). When expensiveMethod() returns, AsyncResponse's resume() method then communicates with the client. If expensiveMethod() takes longer than the timeout threshold, then the client will receive a timeout notice.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="runSuspended" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    The request was made on one thread (currentThread). One then usually sets the timeout in case the AsyncResponse's resume() method (i.e. expensiveMethod() did not return on time) is not called. The alternative method, shown above, uses a CompletableFuture interface that is part of Java SE's Concurrent package.

<h5>Java API for JSON Binding JSON-B</h5>

<p>
    Without further change to the current JSON responses applied thus far, all are managed by the JSON-B (JSON Binding) API. This works both ways, with consumption and production of JSON strings.
</p>

<p>
    In a few (rare) cases, it may be expected that the <i>marshalling</i> (Java objects to JSON or XML) and <i>unmarshalling</i> (JSON or XML to Java objects) processes need to be customised. Generally, the former is part of <i>serialisation</i>, where Java objects are converted into byte streams required for network transfer. The latter stage is part of <i>deserialisation</i> where the byte stream from the network is converted back to a Java object. Consequently, entities are almost always based on beans that implement the Serializable interface. The customisation generally amounts to using more annotations, a few of which are listed below.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="annot">@JsonbDateFormat(value = "yyyy-MM-dd")</span>: use this to annotate LocalDate type fields of the entity</li>
    <li><span class="annot">@JsonbTransient</span>: use this to annotate Collections (fields) that should not be marshalled to JSON (the entity type in the collection would be handled separately)</li>
    <li><span class="annot">@JsonbPropertyOrder(PropertyOrderStrategy.LEXICOGRAPHICAL)</span>: use this to annotate the class (bean) and determine the order in which the JSON fields should appear (lexicographical or alphabetical, or in reverse with REVERSE)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are many other customisations available and are documented in the JSON-B <a href="https://javaee.github.io/jsonb-spec/" target="_blank">repository</a>.
</p>

<h5>Java API for JSON Processing JSON-P</h5>

<p>
    Set some context first. Hypermedia is an extension of HyperText and allows for the presentation of audio, video and hyperlinks in addition to hypertext, in the HTTP response body. A standard, known as <i>Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State</i> (HATEOAS) is a REST architecture where the client interacts with a web service dynamically, that is, a response from the web service actually provides info or directions about what other resources are <i>currently</i> available. Previously, a client would have to make individual HTTP requests for resources with (statically) predefined HTTP URLs. Furthermore, the client would have to be made compatible with the server at build-time in order to access resources. Dynamic interaction is one in which a client makes a single request without knowing anything-else about the server. The web service would then reply with a response, which itself contain more information about what else is available. Clearly, this response needs to be handled with care and not risk exposing resources to all clients all the time.
</p>

<p>
    A server returns URLs in the body of the response as a JSON feed (instead of the header) and the client would then be able to parse and call said URLs. Which actions or URLs are available are dependent on the state of the resource ("Engine of Application State"), which is managed by the web service. If the web service deems that the request URLs are not available, then it is possible to direct the service to not include them in the body of the response. Overall, the interaction of the client and server is dynamic and not set at build-time.
</p>

<p>
    The Java API for JSON Processing <a href="https://javaee.github.io/jsonp/" target="_blank">JSON-P</a> is a more low-level API (compared to JSON-B) can provide some of the hypermedia functionality, in the following example, with links to persistent entities.
</p>

<p>
    The JSON-P responses take the form of key-value pairs, in which the key value is always a Java String. The following resource method builds a new User object and then returns a JSON-P hypermedia response, complete with hyperlinks.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="jsonP" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    The response returned by the service will contain URLs for all other Users, the path to the newly built User and their department. The client can then process the JSON feed and make further requests based on the return.
</p>

<h5>The JAX-RS Client API</h5>

<p>
    The client-side API of JAX-RS provides web services the ability to build instances of clients within a web service. The client lifetime is usually brief and can be used to (temporarily) access other web services via REST calls. The following example attempts to find out which sites, where an email address was applied, have been breached. This is achieved by sending a request from the JAX-RS Client instance to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">haveibeenpwned.com</a> (at the time of writing, the specific endpoint request is documented <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#BreachesForAccount" target="_blank">here</a>).
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="clients" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    The above snippet shows how the JSON arrays are built in a non-reactive and reactive way. A client (external to the web service) can invoke the request, through the web service (that is, client -> web service(JAX-RS client -> haveibeenpwned) return to --> client), using the following resource class.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="clientResource" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    The (external) client will eventually receive a JSON array of all the web sites that have been breached (and when) that have stored the given email address at some point in time.
</p>

<h5>Server Sent Event SSE</h5>

<p>
    SSE is essentially a one-way (unidirectional) communication from the web service to a client. The server can push UTF-8 encoded text to the client. New messages are separated by the new line character "\n". A more advanced technology which is bidirectional are Web Sockets (discussed in the next section). Messaging allows servers to relay information to the client and also trigger events on the client (provided the text sent matches the prerequisite format).
</p>

<p>
    The above example with the method <span class="commands">postUserToSSE()</span> will now explained. When a client has posted a new User entity, the method marshals the new User and returns a response to the client with the expected JSON-P hypermedia. Before the response is sent, the method <span class="commands">postUserToSSE()</span> sends the new User to the JAX-RS client (recall, the JAX-RS client resides within the web service and is primarily used to make requests from the service). The User is sent to the JAX-RS client, a portion is repeated below.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="postUserToSSE" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    This triggers the construction of another JSON-B string, via marshalling. The JAX-RS client is then directed to a URL target and is requesting a plain text response upon making a POST request, using the User's JSON-B feed. The request is actually made to the same web service that defines the JAX-RS client. The route is handled by the web services resource class, ServerSentEventResource, given below. The POST request invokes the broadCastUser() method, which then sends a one-way test stream (with the User's details) via SSE's broadcast() method (defined in the Java EE 8 API, not here) back to any connected client.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="SSE" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    The ServerSentEventResource broadcastUser() then invokes the SseBroadcaster broadcast() method, sending a text message to all connected clients, before returning a HTTP status code to the JAX-RS client, which is then printed to the console. The JAX-RS client then prints the JSON-B string to the console as a final step.
</p>

<p>
    Any client that sends a POST request with a URL encoded form invokes the ServerSentEventResource's ServerSentEventResource() method. This also triggers the SseBroadcaster broadcast() method, and so the connected client receives a text message.
</p>
