<h5>Primary keys</h5>

<p>
    Primary keys can take the form of different Java types, not only (wrapped) Long types. Generally, the floating point types like double and Double are not recommended given the representation is not uniformly defined across systems. 
</p>

<p>
    Primary keys generation types vary. The annotation <span class="annot">@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)</span> assigns responsibility of primary key generation to the JPA provider and is fine for development. For deployment, this is not recommended since more control is generally expected. The primary key is only set once the transaction (for example, an insertion) has been completed.
</p>

<p>
    The annotation <span class="annot">@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)</span> directs supporting providers to generate unique primary keys in a primary key column. Not all implementations support a dedicated primary key column.
</p>

<p>
    Some database implementation enable (indeed, expect) custom sequences of integers to be constructed, using the SEQUENCE command. In these cases, the database does not have an automatic schema generator (requires administration). By default, a primary key is constructed as unit integers, that is, the next key is one integer greater than the previous. The SEQUENCE command can be used to define a different sequence. The application of the custom sequence can be directed using the annotations <span class="annot">@SequenceGenerator</span> in combination with <span class="annot">@GeneratedValue</span>.
</p>

<p>
    A more flexible primary key generator is the Table Generator and tends to be used during deployment. This generates a separate table in the database which specifically acts as a mapper between the Java object and its persistent entity on the database. 
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="jpaTableGenerator" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    Going through each part (above), the name of the table is "pkTable". The primary key column for <i>pkTable</i> is "generatedIDsPKs". The second column in <i>pkTable</i> labelled "latestPK" contains a record of the last primary key that was set. This last column informs the JPA provider what the next key should be, normally one unit integer higher. It examines the value in this column and then proceeds to assign the next entity primary key based on teh value in "latestPK".
</p>

<h5>Relational mapping with JPA</h5>

<p>
    Relationships between two entities can either be unidirectional or bidirectional (explain in more detail shortly). An address related to a employee is normally unidirectional since it makes more sense for the employee to know its address but it does not make sense for an address to know its employee.
</p>

<p>
    The <i>cardinality</i> refers to the number entities at the end of each relationship. From a department's viewpoint, the department will have many employees, and be one-to-many. From the employees viewpoint it would be many-to-one. The cardinality is one for the department and many for the employees, as such.
</p>

<p>
    The <i>ordinality</i> (or "optionality") refers to a boolean which denotes whether or not a entity must be defined when persisting data. Other authors refer to ordinality as the minimum number of entities that must exist in a given relationship. In order for employees to be saved to the database, a department must exist. However, in order for a department to be saved, having employees is not a requirement. From a global viewpoint, the ordinality (in the department-employee relationship) is said to be "0" or false for employee and "1+" or true for the department.
</p>



<h5>Single-valued associations</h5>

<p>
    <i>Single-valued associations</i> are those where there is only one entity at the target end of the relationship. From the employee point of view, whether there is one employee or multiple employees, the target entity (the department) is the sole entity. As such, there are consequently either one-to-one and many-to-one relationships.
</p>

<p>
    The annotations used are <span class="annot">@ManyToOne</span> and <span class="annot">@OneToOne</span>.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="jpaSingleValued" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    To parse this, read the source from the class' point of view. Reading from the Employee literal, of which there are many, is a department, of which there is one. There will be a column in the Employee, known as the <i>foreign key column</i> (in JPA, the "join column", named according to the provider defaults), which references the primary key of the Department table. Thus, the Employee table will store not only the primary keys of its employee entities but also the reference (a foreign key) of the Department entity. The Department table currently does not store references re. the Employees. It does not know anything about Employee entities. As such, the Employee is said to have <b>ownership</b> over the relationship.
</p>

<p>
    By default, the join column name is normally "targetName_id". To customise the name of the join column, annotate the Department field with <span class="annot">@JoinColumn(name = "departmentID")</span>, see above.
</p>

<p>
    One-to-one relationships are single-valued and unidirectional. The owner of the relationship is given by the class that references to the other entity.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="jpaSingleValued2" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    In the above case, Employee is the owner of the relationship. The <span class="annot">@JoinColumn</span> annotation can be applied to the PaySlip reference in the same way. In both one-to-one and many-to-one relationships, one can only traverse from one entity to the other in one direction, that is, from Employee to Department and from Employee to PaySlip. Such relationships are <i>unidirectional</i>.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Bidirectional relationships</i> are those where it is possible to traverse between entities in both directions of the relationship (or continuum). In this case, both entities would need to reference the other entity in their respective Java beans.
</p>

<p>
    To set Office with the ownership via the join column, set as follows. In this case, the Office entity is the owner and the Employee entity is owned.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="jpaBidirectional" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<h5>Multivalued associations</h5>

<p>
    When there is more than one target entity, it gives rise to Collection valued relationships. This includes one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
</p>

<p>
    The one-to-many relationship has been shown previously between employees and the department (above).
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="oneToMany" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    Note that the <span class="annot">@OneToMany</span> annotation ensures that one can traverse from Department <i>to</i> Employee and ensure that the relationship is bidirectional. Without the <span class="annot">@OneToMany</span> annotation, the relationship would be unidirectional (from Employee to Department).
</p>

<p>
    A single entity on the one-side is unable to store the foreign keys of multiple entities from the many-side (a single cell in a row can only hold one value). To proceed, virtually all one-to-many relationships require a complimentary many-to-one declaration given on the one-side's target. That is, <b>one cannot have a <span class="annot">@OneToMany</span> annotation in Department without the <span class="annot">@ManyToOne</span> on the Employee side</b>. The converse though is not a requirement, that is, a <span class="annot">@ManyToOne</span> annotation in Employee can exist without the <span class="annot">@OneToMany</span> in Department. (Each Employee will only need to store one foreign key to one department.) If the <span class="annot">@OneToMany</span> annotation is omitted then the JPA provider will build a separate join table (explained shortly) to enable the one-side to store the foreign keys.
</p>

<p>
    The many-to-many relationship is signified by the <span class="annot">@ManyToMany</span> annotation. This brings in <i>join tables</i> which are separate tables that are solely purposed to store primary keys of the related entities.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="manyToMany" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    The owned table (entity) is signified by a field with <span class="annot">@ManyToMany(mappedBy = "ownerField")</span> annotation.
</p>

<p>
    With the above relationships, it is necessary to control what other related entities are loaded when a contextual instance is constructed. This is handled with options to the relationship annotations. Note that the provider is not bound to fetch lazily or eagerly, and any fetch annotation is considered a suggestion (consult the provider documentation).
</p>

<h5>Embeddable object persistence</h5>

<p>
    Previously Embeddable objects were given their own allocation in the database when the embedded object was persisted to a database. The above example focused on one entity.
</p>

<p>
    To embed a Collection, annotate the field with <span class="annot">@ElementCollection</span>. The HelperClass objects are not JDK entities. Generally all non-JDK entities are flagged with <span class="annot">@ElementCollection</span>. This causes the provider to build a secondary table, where one column stores a reference to the Employee table and the remaining columns relate to the fields of the HelperClass.
</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="jpaEmbeddedCollection" (highlighted)="onHighlight($event)" [languages]="lang"></code>
</pre>

<p>
    The JPA handles the mapping and build of a separate table. The <span class="annot">@CollectionTable</span> overrides the defaults of the secondary table.
</p>

<p>
    Standard JDK entities can be stored along with the owning entity in their own column, as opposed to being stored in a separate table. To handle Collections of standard JDK entities, for example String, use a combination of <span class="annot">@ElementCollection</span> and optionally customise the name of the <span class="annot">@Column(name = "collectionColumnName")</span> annotations.
